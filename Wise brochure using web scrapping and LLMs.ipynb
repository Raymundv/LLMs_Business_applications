      "The Wise story\n",
      "Wise was launched in 2011 with the vision of making international money transfers cheap, fair, and simple. Today, our multi-currency account helps millions of people and businesses manage their money across the world. Here’s how we got here.\n",
      "Like many good stories, this one starts with two friends.\n",
      "They’re both from Estonia. Taavet, who was the first employee at Skype, lived in London but got paid in euros. Kristo worked for Deloitte, also lived in London, and got paid in pounds. But he had a mortgage in euros back in Estonia.\n",
      "They both moved their money with their banks — which had expensive fees and bad exchange rates. They knew there had to be a better way. So they put their heads together and invented a beautifully simple workaround.\n",
      "Set up your free Wise account\n",
      "Play\n",
      "Our mission\n",
      "We believe in money without borders. That's why we're building the best way to move and manage the world’s money. Min fees. Max ease. Full speed.\n",
      "Learn more\n",
      "A better way to move money across borders\n",
      "Each month, they looked up the mid-market exchange rate. Taavet put his euros into Kristo’s Estonian bank account, and Kristo topped up Taavet’s UK account with his pounds. Both got the currency they needed almost instantly, and neither paid an extra cent on bad exchange rates or unreasonable charges.\n",
      "There was no waiting, no stress, and no extra cost. ‘There must be others like us…’ they thought. So they started a company, called it TransferWise, and hired a team to build the best way to send money between countries.\n",
      "As we grew, we realised that people needed more than just money transfers. So we added a multi-currency account, a debit card, and a business account, and changed our name to Wise.\n",
      "Sign up with Wise\n",
      "to start sending, spending, and receiving money internationally\n",
      "Wise today\n",
      "Our name may have changed but the heart of what we do is always the same: helping people manage their money internationally more cheaply, quickly, and transparently.\n",
      "Millions of people and businesses trust us to move their money, saving them bank fees and time. With the Wise account, they hold balances in over 50 currencies, and use our debit card to shop and spend while abroad.\n",
      "We’ve partnered with banks and companies like Monzo, Bolt, and GoCardless, to bring their customers better international banking. And people like Richard Branson, and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, among others, have invested in our vision.\n",
      "Join us today for better international banking\n",
      "Three things we believe about sending money\n",
      "Your money not ours\n",
      "1\n",
      "The fees you pay. The money you keep with us. It’s yours. And we’ll never forget it.\n",
      "Unlike others who may charge you more, we dream smaller — always looking for ways to cut down our fees and earn you a return.\n",
      "Know what you pay\n",
      "2\n",
      "We’re upfront about our fees. No asterisks. No small print. No hidden fees.\n",
      "We’re setting a standard that pushes financial institutions to be honest, creating true transparency for customers, whether you use Wise or not.\n",
      "Max ease at full speed\n",
      "3\n",
      "The world’s a richer place when money moves fast and flows free.\n",
      "Moving country? Setting up a new business? Sending money home? Get it done with smoother service and fewer taps. No stress. Woah.\n",
