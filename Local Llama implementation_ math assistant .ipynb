       "Compound interest is a method of calculating interest where the interest earned over time is added to the principal amount. This means that future interest calculations are based not just on the original principal, but also on the interest that has already been added. This can lead to exponential growth of an investment or savings over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Concepts of Compound Interest\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Principal Amount (P)**: The initial sum of money deposited or invested.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Interest Rate (r)**: The percentage at which the principal amount earns interest, usually expressed annually.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Time (t)**: The duration for which the money is invested or borrowed, typically expressed in years.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Compounding Frequency (n)**: How often the interest is applied to the principal. Common compounding frequencies include:\n",
       "   - Annually (once a year)\n",
       "   - Semi-annually (twice a year)\n",
       "   - Quarterly (four times a year)\n",
       "   - Monthly (twelve times a year)\n",
       "   - Daily (365 times a year)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Compound Interest Formula\n",
       "\n",
       "The formula to calculate the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, is given by:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} $$\n",
       "\n",
       "Where:\n",
       "- $A$ = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\n",
       "- $P$ = the principal investment amount (initial deposit or loan amount)\n",
       "- $r$ = the annual interest rate (decimal)\n",
       "- $n$ = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n",
       "- $t$ = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example\n",
       "\n",
       "Suppose you invest $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually for 10 years. \n",
       "\n",
       "Using the formula:\n",
       "\n",
       "- $P = 1000$\n",
       "- $r = 0.05$\n",
       "- $n = 1$\n",
       "- $t = 10$\n",
       "\n",
       "Plugging these values into the formula:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$ A = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{1}\\right)^{1 \\cdot 10} = 1000 \\left(1.05\\right)^{10} $$\n",
       "\n",
       "Calculating this gives approximately:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$ A \\approx 1000 \\left(1.62889\\right) \\approx 1628.89 $$\n",
       "\n",
       "So, after 10 years, the investment would grow to approximately $1628.89.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Benefits of Compound Interest\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Exponential Growth**: Over time, compound interest can significantly increase the value of savings or investments.\n",
       "- **Encourages Saving**: Knowing that one can earn interest on interest may encourage individuals to save more.\n",
       "- **Long-term Benefits**: The earlier you start investing, the more you can benefit from compound interest. This is often why financial advisors stress the importance of starting to save early.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Loan Repayment**: Compound interest is not only applicable to savings and investments but also to loans. For loans, it can lead to higher repayment amounts if not managed properly.\n",
       "- **Risk of Compounding**: Compound interest can work against you in debt situations, leading to larger amounts owed over time if minimum payments are made.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, understanding compound interest schemes in banking is crucial for effective saving and investing strategies, enabling individuals to maximize their financial growth over time."

       "Special Relativity\n",
       "====================\n",
       "### Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "Special relativistic physics is a fundamental component of modern physics that introduced significant changes to our understanding of space and time. It was formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905 as a response to the Michelson-Morley experiment, which aimed to measure the speed of light's dependence on motion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key Concepts\n",
       "-------------\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **The Speed of Light is Constant**: A fundamental postulate that states the speed of light is always constant, regardless of motion.\n",
       "2. **Time Dilation**: Time appears to pass slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n",
       "3. **Length Contraction**: Objects appear shorter to an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n",
       "4. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: Two events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another observer in a different state of motion.\n",
       "5. **Lorentz Transformation**: A mathematical equation that describes the transformation of spacetime coordinates between two observers moving at constant velocity relative to each other.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mathematical Representation\n",
       "-------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "The Lorentz transformation can be written as:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$t = \\gamma (t')$$\n",
       "\n",
       "Where:\n",
       "- $t$ is the proper time measured by a stationary observer.\n",
       "- $t'$ is the time measured by an observer in motion, $v$, with respect to the stationary observer.\n",
       "- $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n",
       "\n",
       "This transformation shows that time appears to slow down for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer. The same reasoning applies to space, which becomes contracted along the direction of motion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Effects of Special Relativity\n",
       "---------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **No absolute motion**: There is no preferred frame of reference.\n",
       "2. **Energy and momentum are relativistic vectors**: Not constant as classical mechanics has it, but only when measured with respect to a moving system.\n",
       "3. **No time dilation for slow speeds**: Only at high speed (approaching $c$).\n",
       "\n",
       "Empirical Validation\n",
       "-----------------\n",
       "\n",
       "Experiments that validate the principles of special relativity include:\n",
       "\n",
